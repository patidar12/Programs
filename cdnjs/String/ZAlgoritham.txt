used for pattern searching in a string

Z-Function:
Z(k): length of longest substring starting at k which is also the prefix of the string
Z is an array

ex. :
string = "aacbyaakaac"
Z = [0,1,0,0,0,2,1,0,3,1,0]

Heare,
Z[8] = 3
Means in string there is a substring of length 3 started with index 8 which is also prefix of the string(0-2)


Pattern search using Z- Function:

text = "yabckabdabc"
pattern = "abc"

construct a string pattern + '$' + text
ie. string = "abc$yabckabdabc"
construct Z-Array for the new string:

string = "abc$yabckabdabc"
z = [0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,2,0,0,3,0,0]

Now in array if Z[k] == len(pattern)
Means pattern available in the text and we can get the index of pattern in text

index = k - (len(pattern) + 1)
where index is the starting index of pattern in the text.
Time Complexity = O(M + N) for finding all the pattern
