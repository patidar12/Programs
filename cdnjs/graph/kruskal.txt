Algo:
Pik the edge with minimum weight
Skip the edge which will from the cycle


Detect Cycle:

If two vertices already included in MST and as path b/w them,
then they from a cycle, we have to ignore this Edge.
Time complexity: O(E) ~ O(V^2)

Union Find Algorithm:
we have to mentain a perent for every vertex
If the parent of two vertex is same than they from the cycle.

Time complexity using Union Find(ElogE + E*V)
1) Taking Input O(E)
2) Sort the array of edges (ElogE)
3) Pick (V-1) Edges from E and from Mst:  O(E)
    Cycle detection O(V)
   O(E*V) 
   
Union By rank and path Comperision Algorithm:  
    we can reduce complexity of cycle detection to O(logV)
