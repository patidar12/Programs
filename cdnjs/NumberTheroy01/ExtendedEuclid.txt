we know that:
gcd(a,b) = gcd(b, a%b) given a>b

From Extended Euclid algorithm :
 aX + bY = gcd(a,b)
 from this find X, Y
From Diophantine we can say that X, Y should be integer
because aX + bY = c
here c is gcd(a,b)


Using Extended Euclid Calcualate value of X, Y

aX + bY = gcd(a, b) = gcd(b, a%b)
bX1 + (a%b)Y1 = gcd(b, a%b)
 we know that:
 a%b = a - b*(a/b)

bX1 + (a - b*(a/b))Y1 = gcd(a,a%b) = gcd(a, b)

bX1 + (a - b*(a/b))Y1 = aX + bY
b (X1 - (a/b)Y1) + aY1 = aX + bY

compare the cofficient a and b:

X = Y1
Y = X1 - (a/b)Y1
 Using this two formula we can calculate X and Y using Euclid Algorithm
