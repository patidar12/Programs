Multipicative Inverse:

find value of B for which A*B = 1

A*(1/A) = 1 i.e. B = 1/A or B = A inverse
ex. 12*B = 1
then B = 1/12


Multipicative modulo inverse:
(A*B) mod m = 1

for ex. A = 5, m = 17

we have to find B for which above condition hold

then check for every starting from 1

B = 7

(5*7)mod 17 = 1
