ax + by = d
given a, b ,d
find number of pairs of (x, y) such that above condition hold


Solution 1:

x,y >= 0
from the above equation,
range of x and y
0 <= x <= d/a
0 <= y <= d/b

we can run two loop
for x in 0 to d/a
   for y in 0 to d/b
      check if above equation satisfied with (x,y)

Time Complexity:

O((d/a)*(d/b)) -> O((d^2)/(a*b))
 

Solution 2:

ax + by = d

0 <= x <= d/a
0 <= y <= d/b

ax = d - by  ----(1)

in this equation we can check for every value of y that d - by is divisible from a
if it is divisible from a than we can get value of x from the above equation for corrosponding y

Time Complexity : O(d/b)

Solution 3:

ax + by = d
ax = d - by
let say smallest value of y for that (d - by) is divisible by a is y1
so (d - by)%a = 0 for y = y1

so next value of y should be
y1 + a
y1 + 2*a
.

we know that last term should be less than d/b from 0 <= y <= d/b
let say last etrm is:

y1 + na <= d/b
na <= d/b - y1
n <= (d/b - y1)/a  from this equation we can find value of n in O(1)

So including the smallest value we have (n+1) term
So We have (n+1) pairs


Now for finding y1 in worst case may take O(d/b)


Reducing complexity to find y1:

(d - by)%a = 0
we want minimum value of y such that above condition hold

d%a - (b%a) * (y%a) = 0
in above equation on value of y is changing other are constant

So if we found y1 corrosponding to (y%a) such that above condition is hold

ax + by = d
by = d - ax
y = (d - ax)/b

y%a = (d/b)%a - (ax/b)%a
last term (ax/b)%a is zero because a is multipling in the number os taking modulo with a give result zero

y%a = (d/b)%a


if we put the value in d%a - (b%a) * (y%a) = 0

d%a - (b%a) * ((d/b)%a) = 0

this is hold so we can use
y1 = (d/b)%a

using y1 we can calculate value of n from n <= (d/b - y1)/a


Now for calculating (d/b)%a
=> d*modInverse(b,a)

=> ((d%a) * modInverse(b,a))%a 

calculating modInverse take O(log(min(a,b)))

Other task we can done in O(1)

Time complexity : O(log(min(a,b)))
