Diophantine Equations:
 - This are Polinominal Equation -
   properties:
        - Integrel Solution Exist
	- Unknown should be integer
          ex. aX + bY = c  (X, Y are Unknown)

Linear Diophantine Equations:

Ex- aX + bY = c  a,b,c belong to Z (integer)

then x, y are integer only if
gcd(a,b) divides c


For Ex.
 3X + 6Y = 8
 gcd(3, 6) = 3
 8 is not divisible by 3
 integrel Solution does not exist
