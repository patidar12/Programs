Directed Graph
component of graph from which there is no outgooing edge

Algorithm:

1) Find all the Strongaly connected components
2) For all vertices check outgoing edges to see if they are
 going out of the component
    If edge going out of the component, then it is not bottom of the graph
    else It is the bottom of the graph
