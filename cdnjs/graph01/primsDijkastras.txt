Note: Similar we can use for Dijkastras 
Dijkastras: used to find minimum distance from src to all other vertices
Prims: Used to find minimum spanning tree

Algo:
for every vertex (0,V) -> O(V)
   find minVertex in weight array -> O(V)
   update weight of adjacent vertex from minVertex  -> O(V) (adjacency Matrix)

Time Complexity: O(V) * O(V+V -> O(V^2))

we can reduce the time complexity:
  1) we can use priority queue for weight array log(V)
  2) we can use adjacency list insted of adjacency metrix, while updating the weight of adjacent
     only need to run the loop for adjacent vertex.
  reduce to O(ElogV)
